# IBM Machine Learning with Python- Final Project

This project is a part of **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**  

Main objective of this project is to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.   

Dataset consists of the data from previous loan applications. Following algorithms were used to build the models:  

k-Nearest Neighbour  
Decision Tree  
Support Vector Machine  
Logistic Regression      

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index  
F1-score  
LogLoass
